                <p>
                    Project Stable Staples is a <b>GROUND-UP INITIATIVE</b> in partnership with <a href="https://sg-bless.org/" target="_blank">BLESS</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're hoping to tide large families in rental communities through COVID-related income loss, and we are seeking donors to join us in giving fortnightly grocery vouchers to the affected families, for three months and possibly beyond.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Families living in rental units with at least 2 children, experiencing a fall in income (due to loss / reduction in part time work).

                    We aim to give $5 NTUC voucher to each individual per week. Assuming the family has 4 members, they will get $20 a week, i.e. $80 a month. Hopefully, this will allow them to get some stable staples.

                    <p>
                        Working closely with Social Service Offices and Community Development Councils, we are able to identify the families in need of further financial assistance due to their difficult circumstances.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our volunteers engage each beneficiary individually to understand their concerns and needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Amongst the families in rental units who meet the criteria (part-time worker(s) experiencing income loss with at least 2 children), the largest families will receive the vouchers first. We hope to raise enough funds to help all these families in each rental block.
                    </p>
                </div>

                        What about those who don't live in rental flats but are also affected?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        We are doing our part to reach out to the most vulnerable group first. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Often, families residing in rental blocks have sole breadwinners who rely on precarious work to provide for multiple children. Many of them are experiencing income loss now. They are only eligible for the one-time Care & Support (cash payouts), and $300 NTUC grocery vouchers (for the rest of 2020). While they can depend on the cash support to pay part of their bills and existing arrears (e.g, rent, electricity, transport etc) for a while, we have heard of real concerns through our home visits that they would not be able to afford food and other daily necessities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additional financial support through the Resilience Package will relieve the situations of many individuals affected by this COVID-19 crisis.

                        Have you considered providing e-vouchers instead?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Although using e-vouchers is more efficient, it is not ideal as the beneficiaries are unlikely to hit the minimum order to qualify for free delivery. Hence, physical vouchers are more suitable for their use.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="l-box pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2 pure-u-lg-1-4">

                        Why are the vouchers donated in $5 and $10 denominations only?

                    <p>
                        Depending on family size, different families will receive different voucher amounts. Smaller denominations allow flexibility for them to plan how and when to use the vouchers at their own discretion.

                        Presently, we are looking to support these families for three months. If we are able to raise more funds, we will aim to tide them through a longer period.

                        With our current resources, we are only able to focus on serving one area. When there are sufficient funds, we hope to reach out to families beyond the Boon Lay district.

                        It is the most ideal channel of collection that requires minimal transaction fees (0.25%), unlike other payment gateways or fundraising platforms (1.5%+). This allows us to ensure that the money collected is able to reach these families.
