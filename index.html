                    Why Project Stable Staples?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Project Stable Staples is a ground-up initiative that seeks to tide families who live in rental blocks that are affected by COVID-19. In particular, we are looking at families who hold part-time jobs that suffered a loss in income. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are looking to support families with multiple children living in rental flats, who rely on part-time job income suffering a loss in employment during the COVID-19 crisis. To tide them through this period, we are seeking donors to join us in giving monthly grocery vouchers to the affected families, for three months and possibly beyond.

                    What are we trying to do?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The recent announcement of additional financial support for the families as part of the resilience package is a relief for these families. However, most of them are only eligible for the Care & Support (Cash) and the $300 NTUC grocery vouchers in 2020. Assuming a low-income single mother (part-timer) with 3 young children, the family will receive $1800 cash support and a $300 NTUC grocery voucher. The additional cash support is able to assist them to pay part of their bills and existing arrears (e.g, rent, electricity, transport etc) for a while. However, there are real concerns that they would not have money to buy food and other daily necessities. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Project Stable Staples primary focus is to provide NTUC vouchers to tide them through this period. The vouchers will be an interim support, with the amount scaled according to the size of the family. With these vouchers, beneficiaries do not need to worry about not being able to put food on their table during this difficult period. We would also be working closely with NTUC

                        Can we donate to send beneficiaries e-vouchers instead?

                    <p>
                        We explored this, and understand it's a more efficient method. However, it's not ideal as the minimum order has to be $59 for free delivery – beneficiaries are likely disincentivised to purchase items from Fairprice Online, using the e-vouchers. Physical vouchers will be most useful for the families.
