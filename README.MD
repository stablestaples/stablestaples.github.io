# What is this

Project Stable Staples is a Ground Up Initiative in partnership with BLESS

We're hoping to tide large families in rental communities through COVID-related income loss, and we are seeking donors to join us in giving fortnightly grocery vouchers to the affected families, for three months and possibly beyond.

This respository will serve as the site for this initiative, and can be found [here](https://projectstablestaples.sg).

The website is build on top of the [marketing layout](https://purecss.io/layouts/marketing/) provided by [PureCSS](https://purecss.io/).
